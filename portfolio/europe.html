        	        <p>While on a school trip to Paris, I had the opportunity to try out the French Cuisine. For the first time ever, I had snails, and it was quite an experience. Although the snails had a very chewy touch to it that gave it a yummy touch, the idea of eating snails was very hard.</p>

        	      <h4>Most Memorable Adventure</h4>  
        	        <p>When looking back, my time in Venice was a very unique experience. Venice was a city like no other, beautiful in every way. Instead of having car vehicles as taxis, they used boats as taxis. In that itself the city was unique. I had the chance to take a gondola ride in Venice, and it was a great time. Although the gondola was rocky and there was more than one instance where the gondola almost turned over, it was still a great time.</p>
